# Taxi-Fare-Amount-Prediction-Project
## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the total fare amount for taxi rides. The project utilizes a dataset comprising various attributes of taxi journeys, including pickup and dropoff times, distance traveled, payment type, and more. The goal is to develop predictive models that accurately estimate the total fare amount, contributing to the challenge of enhancing the efficiency of fare predictions for taxi rides.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following files:

- `train.csv` : The training set containing the target variable 'total_amount' and accompanying feature attributes.
- `test.csv`: The test set containing similar feature attributes but without the target variable.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file provided in the correct format for competition submissions.

## Columns Description
Key columns in the dataset include:

- `total_amount`: The total amount paid by the traveler for the taxi ride.
- `VendorID`: Identifier for taxi vendors.
- `tpep_pickup_datetime` and `tpep_dropoff_datetime`: Timestamps indicating pickup and dropoff times.
- `passenger_count`: Number of passengers during the ride.
- `trip_distance`: Distance traveled during the trip.
- `RatecodeID`: Rate code for the ride.
- `store_and_fwd_flag`: Flag indicating whether the trip data was stored and forwarded.
- `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID`: Pickup and dropoff location identifiers.
- `payment_type`: Payment type used for the ride.

## Project Solution
The project solution includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
  - Initial data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
  - Data cleaning to handle missing values, incorrect entries, and outliers.
  - Feature engineering to extract relevant information from timestamps and other categorical variables.
  -Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots for deeper insights into the data.

2. Model Building:

  - Utilization of various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Bagging Regressor, Voting Regressor, KNeighbors Regressor, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for each model to optimize performance.
  - Evaluation of models using training and validation set scores.

3. Final Prediction:

  - Selection of the best-performing model (Random Forest Regressor) based on evaluation scores.
  - Prediction on the test set using the best estimator obtained after hyperparameter tuning.

## Results

> The final prediction achieved an R-squared score of 0.93 on the test set, indicating the effectiveness of the developed model in accurately estimating the total fare amount for taxi rides.
